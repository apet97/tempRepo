/**
 * @fileoverview Calculation Engine - Pure Overtime & Billable Analysis
 *
 * This module implements the core business logic for OTPLUS overtime calculations.
 * It is completely side-effect free: no DOM manipulation, no network calls, no localStorage.
 * All calculations are deterministic - same inputs ALWAYS produce same outputs.
 *
 * ## Module Responsibility
 * - Classify time entries into WORK, BREAK, and PTO types
 * - Calculate effective capacity per user per day (overrides → profile → global default)
 * - Apply capacity adjustments for holidays, time-off, and non-working days
 * - Implement tail attribution algorithm for overtime split
 * - Compute billable/non-billable breakdowns and multi-tier overtime premiums
 * - Generate per-entry, per-day, and per-user aggregated analysis
 *
 * ## Key Dependencies
 * - `utils.js` - Date parsing (parseIsoDuration), rounding, entry classification
 * - `types.js` - TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
 * - `state.js` - Store interface for accessing config, profiles, holidays, overrides
 *
 * ## Data Flow
 * Input: TimeEntry[] (from Clockify Reports API), Store (config + overrides), DateRange
 * Processing:
 *   1. Group entries by user and date
 *   2. For each user/day: determine effective capacity (considering holidays/time-off)
 *   3. Sort entries chronologically and apply tail attribution algorithm
 *   4. Split each entry into regular/overtime hours
 *   5. Calculate amounts with tier1/tier2 multipliers
 *   6. Aggregate to day totals and user totals
 * Output: UserAnalysis[] (one per user, with days Map and totals)
 *
 * ## Business Rules (CRITICAL - DO NOT CHANGE WITHOUT UPDATING TESTS)
 *
 * ### Entry Classification (see docs/prd.md "Overtime Calculation Guide")
 * - **WORK entries** (`type === 'REGULAR'` or undefined): Can be regular OR overtime
 *   - Accumulate toward daily capacity
 *   - Subject to tail attribution algorithm
 * - **BREAK entries** (`type === 'BREAK'`): Always regular hours
 *   - Count as regular in totals
 *   - Do NOT accumulate toward capacity (don't trigger OT for other entries)
 *   - Can NEVER become overtime themselves
 * - **PTO entries** (`type === 'HOLIDAY'` or `'TIME_OFF'`): Always regular hours
 *   - Same behavior as BREAK
 *   - Still contribute to billable/non-billable breakdown if flagged as billable
 *
 * ### Capacity Precedence (per user, per day)
 * 1. Per-day user override (`overrides[userId].perDayOverrides[dateKey].capacity`)
 * 2. Weekly user override (`overrides[userId].weeklyOverrides[weekday].capacity`)
 * 3. Global user override (`overrides[userId].capacity`)
 * 4. Profile capacity (`profiles.get(userId).workCapacityHours`) - if `useProfileCapacity` enabled
 * 5. Global daily threshold (`calcParams.dailyThreshold`, default 8h)
 *
 * ### Effective Capacity Adjustments
 * Base capacity is adjusted to zero or reduced based on day context:
 * - **Holiday** (from API or entry type): capacity → 0 (all WORK is overtime)
 * - **Non-working day** (per profile `workingDays`): capacity → 0
 * - **Time-off** (from API or entry type): capacity reduced by time-off hours
 *   - Full-day time-off: capacity → 0
 *   - Partial time-off: capacity = max(0, capacity - timeOffHours)
 * - **Precedence**: Holiday/non-working day takes precedence over time-off (both result in 0)
 *
 * ### Tail Attribution Algorithm
 * Overtime is assigned to the LAST entries of the day (chronologically).
 * For each day:
 *   1. Sort entries by `timeInterval.start` (earliest first)
 *   2. Initialize `dailyAccumulator = 0`
 *   3. For each entry:
 *      - If BREAK or PTO: `regular = duration, overtime = 0`, skip accumulation
 *      - If WORK:
 *        - If `accumulator >= capacity`: entire entry is OT
 *        - Else if `accumulator + duration <= capacity`: entire entry is regular
 *        - Else: split entry at capacity boundary
 *        - Increment `accumulator += duration` (WORK only)
 *
 * ### Billable Breakdown
 * Tracks 4 independent buckets:
 * - `billableWorked` = sum of `entry.analysis.regular` where `billable === true`
 * - `nonBillableWorked` = sum of `entry.analysis.regular` where `billable === false`
 * - `billableOT` = sum of `entry.analysis.overtime` where `billable === true`
 * - `nonBillableOT` = sum of `entry.analysis.overtime` where `billable === false`
 *
 * ### Multi-Tier Overtime Premiums
 * - **Tier 1 (all OT)**: All overtime hours get tier1 premium = `(multiplier - 1) * overtimeHours * rate`
 * - **Tier 2 (beyond threshold)**: OT hours beyond `tier2Threshold` get additional premium = `(tier2Multiplier - multiplier) * tier2Hours * rate`
 * - Tier2 accumulator is tracked per USER (not per day) across the entire date range
 *
 * ### Amount Types
 * Three parallel calculations for each entry:
 * - **Earned**: Billable revenue (from `earnedRate` or `amounts.EARNED`)
 * - **Cost**: Internal cost (from `costRate` or `amounts.COST`)
 * - **Profit**: Earned - Cost
 * Display mode (`config.amountDisplay`) selects which is shown as "primary" amount.
 *
 * ### Rounding
 * - Hours: 4 decimal places (0.0001h = 0.36s precision)
 * - Currency: 2 decimal places
 * - Applied at aggregation boundary (after summing) to prevent floating-point drift
 *
 * ## Edge Cases Handled
 * - Null/undefined entries array: treated as empty array, still calculates capacity
 * - Missing dateRange: derived from entry dates (minDate/maxDate)
 * - Users without entries: still appear in results with expectedCapacity calculated
 * - Missing user profiles: fall back to global defaults
 * - Midnight-spanning entries: attributed entirely to start day (no splitting across dates)
 * - Malformed durations: parseIsoDuration returns 0, entry contributes 0 hours
 * - Missing rates: default to 0 (no crash)

// HELPER FUNCTIONS - Rate & Duration Extraction
// ============================================================================
// These functions safely extract numeric values from Clockify API responses,
// which can vary in format between API versions and entry types.
// All rate values are normalized to cents (integer representation) to avoid
// floating-point precision issues in currency calculations.
// ============================================================================

/**
 * Safely extracts a numeric rate from various Clockify API formats.
 *
 * The Clockify Reports API has inconsistent rate representations:
 * - Legacy format: numeric value in cents (e.g., 5000 = $50.00/hr)
 * - New format: object with `amount` property in cents (e.g., {amount: 5000})
 * - Missing rate: null or undefined
 *
 * This function normalizes all formats to a numeric value in cents.
 *
 * ## Why Cents?
 * Storing rates as integers (cents) avoids floating-point precision errors
 * in currency calculations. $50.00 stored as 5000 cents can be safely
 * multiplied and added without rounding errors.
 *
 * ## Edge Cases
 * - `null` or `undefined` → 0 (no crash, entry contributes $0)
 * - Object without `amount` property → 0
 * - Object with `amount: null` → 0
 *
 * @param rateField - Rate value from API (number, object, or null/undefined)
 * @returns Rate in cents (integer), or 0 if invalid/missing
 *
 * @example
 * extractRate(5000) // → 5000 (legacy format)
 * extractRate({amount: 5000}) // → 5000 (new format)
 * extractRate(null) // → 0 (missing rate)
 * extractRate({amount: null}) // → 0 (invalid object)

/**
 * Extracts entry duration in hours, with fallback calculation.
 *
 * Clockify Reports API provides duration in ISO 8601 format (e.g., "PT8H30M").
 * This function attempts to parse the duration string, and falls back to
 * calculating duration from start/end timestamps if parsing fails or returns 0.
 *
 * ## Algorithm
 * 1. Primary: Parse `entry.timeInterval.duration` as ISO 8601 (via parseIsoDuration)
 * 2. Fallback: If duration is 0 and start/end exist, calculate: (end - start) in hours
 * 3. If all fails: return 0 (entry contributes 0 hours)
 *
 * ## Why Fallback?
 * Some Clockify API responses have missing or malformed duration strings.
 * The fallback ensures we still calculate hours correctly by using timestamps.
 *
 * ## Edge Cases
 * - Malformed ISO duration (e.g., "INVALID") → parseIsoDuration returns 0, fallback activates
 * - Missing timeInterval → returns 0 (safe handling)
 * - Invalid date strings → isNaN check prevents bad calculations, returns 0
 * - Negative duration (end < start) → rare, but would return negative hours (caller should validate)
 *
 * @param entry - Time entry from Clockify Reports API
 * @returns Duration in hours (decimal), or 0 if unable to determine
 *
 * @example
 * getEntryDurationHours({timeInterval: {duration: "PT8H"}}) // → 8.0
 * getEntryDurationHours({timeInterval: {start: "2024-01-01T09:00:00Z", end: "2024-01-01T17:00:00Z"}}) // → 8.0
 * getEntryDurationHours({timeInterval: null}) // → 0 (missing interval)
 *
 * @see parseIsoDuration - Utility function for parsing ISO 8601 durations
 */

/**
 * Sums all amounts of a specific type from Clockify's amounts array.
 *
 * Clockify Reports API entries can contain an `amounts` array with multiple
 * amount types: "EARNED" (billable revenue), "COST" (internal cost), etc.
 * This function filters and sums amounts matching a specific type.
 *
 * ## API Format Variations
 * The amounts array has inconsistent property names across API versions:
 * - `amount.type` or `amount.amountType` for the type identifier
 * - `amount.value` or `amount.amount` for the numeric value
 * This function handles both variations.
 *
 * ## Amount Types (from Clockify API)
 * - "EARNED" - Billable revenue (what client is charged)
 * - "COST" - Internal cost (what company pays employee)
 * - Type matching is case-insensitive (normalized to uppercase)
 *
 * ## Edge Cases
 * - Empty or null amounts array → 0
 * - Missing type property → skipped (doesn't match)
 * - Invalid numeric value (NaN, Infinity) → skipped (Number.isFinite check)
 * - Null amount object → skipped (optional chaining)
 *
 * @param amounts - Array of amount objects from Clockify entry
 * @param targetType - Amount type to sum (e.g., "EARNED", "COST") - case-insensitive
 * @returns Sum of all amounts matching targetType, in currency units (not cents)
 *
 * @example
 * sumAmountByType([{type: "EARNED", value: 120}, {type: "COST", value: 80}], "EARNED") // → 120
 * sumAmountByType([{amountType: "earned", amount: 50}], "EARNED") // → 50 (case-insensitive, alternate property names)
 * sumAmountByType(null, "EARNED") // → 0 (null array)

/**
 * Calculates hourly rate from total amount and duration.
 *
 * When hourly rate fields (e.g., `earnedRate`, `costRate`) are missing or zero,
 * this function derives the rate by dividing total amount by hours worked.
 * This is used as a fallback to ensure we always have rate information.
 *
 * ## Algorithm
 * 1. Sum all amounts of targetType (via sumAmountByType)
 * 2. Divide by duration to get hourly rate
 * 3. Convert from currency units to cents (* 100)
 * 4. Round to 2 decimal places for consistency
 *
 * ## Why Convert to Cents?
 * The Reports API returns amounts in currency units (e.g., $120.00 = 120).
 * We convert to cents (12000) to match the format of `hourlyRate` fields,
 * which are always in cents. This ensures consistent rate handling.
 *
 * ## Edge Cases
 * - Zero duration → 0 (prevent division by zero)
 * - Zero total amount → 0 (no rate to derive)
 * - Invalid amounts (NaN/Infinity) → 0 (Number.isFinite check)
 *
 * @param amounts - Array of amount objects from Clockify entry
 * @param targetType - Amount type to calculate rate for (e.g., "EARNED", "COST")
 * @param durationHours - Entry duration in hours (must be > 0)
 * @returns Hourly rate in cents, rounded to 2 decimal places, or 0 if invalid
 *
 * @example
 * rateFromAmounts([{type: "EARNED", value: 120}], "EARNED", 8) // → 1500 (=$15/hr in cents)
 * rateFromAmounts([{type: "COST", value: 80}], "COST", 8) // → 1000 (=$10/hr in cents)
 * rateFromAmounts([], "EARNED", 8) // → 0 (no amounts)

 *
 * This function normalizes rate data from multiple possible sources:
 * 1. Direct rate fields: `earnedRate`, `costRate`, `hourlyRate`
 * 2. Calculated from amounts array: derive rate from total amount / duration
 *
 * The function uses a waterfall approach: prefer direct fields, fall back to
 * calculated rates from amounts.
 *
 * ## Special Handling for Non-Billable Entries
 * Non-billable entries (where `billable === false`) have their earned rate
 * forced to 0, because they should not contribute to billable revenue totals.
 * Cost rate is unaffected (we still track internal costs for non-billable work).
 *
 * ## Rate Resolution Priority
 * **Earned Rate**:
 * 1. `entry.earnedRate` (if present and billable)
 * 2. `entry.hourlyRate` (if present and billable)
 * 3. Calculated from `amounts.EARNED` (if billable)
 * 4. 0 (if non-billable or all sources missing)
 *
 * **Cost Rate**:
 * 1. `entry.costRate` (if present)
 * 2. Calculated from `amounts.COST`
 * 3. 0 (if all sources missing)
 *
 * **Profit Rate**: Always calculated as `earned - cost`
 *
 * ## Why Three Rate Types?
 * - **Earned**: Tracks billable revenue for client invoicing
 * - **Cost**: Tracks internal expenses for profitability analysis
 * - **Profit**: Measures profitability per hour worked
 * The user can select which amount type to display via `config.amountDisplay`.

 * // Non-billable entry (earned forced to 0)

/**
 * Gets the base capacity for a user on a specific day (before adjustments).
 *
 * This function implements the **capacity precedence hierarchy** defined in docs/prd.md.
 * It selects the most specific capacity value available, cascading through multiple
 * sources until a valid value is found.
 *
 * ## Capacity Precedence (highest to lowest)
 * 1. **Per-day override**: User-specific override for this exact date
 *    - Most specific, overrides everything else
 *    - Use case: Special capacity for a specific date (e.g., half-day, extended hours)
 *
 * 2. **Weekly override**: User-specific override for this day of week
 *    - Applies to all instances of this weekday (e.g., all Fridays)
 *    - Use case: Consistent weekly patterns (e.g., 6h every Friday)
 *
 * 3. **Global user override**: User-specific override for all days
 *    - Applies to all days unless more specific override exists
 *    - Use case: Employee with non-standard capacity (e.g., part-time 6h/day)
 *
 * 4. **Profile capacity**: User's workCapacityHours from Clockify profile
 *    - Only used if `config.useProfileCapacity` is enabled
 *    - Use case: Leverage Clockify profile data for automatic capacity
 *
 * 5. **Global default**: System-wide daily threshold
 *    - Fallback when no other source exists
 *    - Default: 8 hours (standard workday)
 *
 * ## IMPORTANT: This Returns BASE Capacity
 * This function returns the **base capacity** before adjustments. The caller must
 * apply additional adjustments for:
 * - Holidays (capacity → 0)
 * - Non-working days (capacity → 0)
 * - Time-off (capacity reduced by time-off hours)
 *
 * See the main calculation function for adjustment logic.
 *
 * ## Value Parsing
 * Override values can be stored as strings or numbers (due to form input handling).
 * We safely parse to float and validate with isNaN check.
 *
 * @param userId - User ID to look up overrides/profile for
 * @param dateKey - Date in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., "2024-01-15")
 * @param store - Application store containing overrides, profiles, and config
 * @returns Base capacity in hours (before holiday/time-off adjustments)
 *
 * @example
 * // Per-day override exists
 * getEffectiveCapacity("user123", "2024-01-15", store) // → 4 (half-day override)
 *
 * // Weekly override (Fridays are 6h)
 * getEffectiveCapacity("user123", "2024-01-19", store) // → 6 (Friday override)
 *
 * // Global user override
 * getEffectiveCapacity("user123", "2024-01-16", store) // → 6 (part-time employee)
 *
 * // Profile capacity
 * getEffectiveCapacity("user456", "2024-01-15", store) // → 7.5 (from Clockify profile)
 *
 * // Global default
 * getEffectiveCapacity("user789", "2024-01-15", store) // → 8 (default threshold)
 *
 * @see getHoliday - Check if day is a holiday (capacity → 0)
 * @see isWorkingDay - Check if day is a working day (capacity → 0 if not)
 * @see getTimeOff - Get time-off hours (reduce capacity)

 *
 * DayMeta captures all the contextual information about a day that affects
 * capacity and overtime calculations. This metadata is stored alongside
 * the day's entries and is used for UI display and debugging.
 *
 * ## Purpose
 * - Record the effective capacity after all adjustments
 * - Track special day types (holiday, non-working day, time-off)
 * - Provide context for UI rendering (e.g., highlight holidays in red)
 * - Enable audit trail (understand WHY capacity was set to a specific value)
 *
 * ## Field Meanings
 * - `capacity`: Final effective capacity for this day (after all adjustments)
 * - `isHoliday`: True if day is a holiday (from API or entry type)
 * - `holidayName`: Name of the holiday (e.g., "Christmas"), empty string if not holiday
 * - `isNonWorking`: True if day is not in user's workingDays (e.g., weekend)
 * - `isTimeOff`: True if user has time-off on this day (full or partial)
 * - `holidayProjectId`: Clockify project ID for the holiday (if applicable)
 *
 * ## Capacity Calculation Trace
 * By examining dayMeta, you can understand why capacity has a specific value:
 * - capacity = 0 + isHoliday = true → Holiday, all work is OT
 * - capacity = 0 + isNonWorking = true → Off-day, all work is OT
 * - capacity = 4 + isTimeOff = true → Half-day time-off (8h - 4h = 4h)
 * - capacity = 8 + all flags false → Normal working day
 *
 * @param capacity - Effective capacity in hours (after all adjustments)
 * @param isHoliday - Whether this is a holiday
 * @param holidayName - Holiday name (empty string if not a holiday)
 * @param isNonWorking - Whether this is a non-working day per profile
 * @param isTimeOff - Whether user has time-off on this day
 * @param holidayProjectId - Clockify project ID for holiday entries (optional)
 * @returns DayMeta object
 *
 * @example

 * For each amount type (earned/cost/profit), calculate:
 *
 * 1. **Regular Amount**: `regularHours * hourlyRate`
 *    - Payment for hours within capacity (no premium)
 *
 * 2. **Overtime Base Amount**: `overtimeHours * hourlyRate`
 *    - Base payment for OT hours (before premium)
 *
 * 3. **Tier1 Premium**: `(multiplier - 1) * overtimeHours * hourlyRate`
 *    - Additional payment for ALL overtime hours at tier1 rate
 *    - Example: multiplier 1.5 → 0.5x additional pay per OT hour
 *
 * 4. **Tier2 Premium**: `(tier2Multiplier - multiplier) * tier2Hours * hourlyRate`
 *    - ADDITIONAL premium for tier2 hours beyond tier1
 *    - Only applies to hours beyond tier2Threshold
 *    - Example: tier1=1.5, tier2=2.0 → additional 0.5x pay for tier2 hours
 *
 * 5. **Total Amount with OT**: `regularAmount + overtimeBase + tier1Premium + tier2Premium`
 *
 * 6. **Total Amount without OT**: `regularAmount` (for comparison/reporting)
 *
 * ## Two-Tier Premium Example
 * - Regular rate: $20/hr, multiplier: 1.5, tier2Multiplier: 2.0
 * - Hours: 8 regular, 12 OT (10 tier1, 2 tier2)
 * - Regular amount: 8 * $20 = $160
 * - OT base: 12 * $20 = $240
 * - Tier1 premium: (1.5 - 1) * 12 * $20 = $120 (ALL OT hours)
 * - Tier2 premium: (2.0 - 1.5) * 2 * $20 = $20 (tier2 hours only)
 * - Total: $160 + $240 + $120 + $20 = $540
 *
 * ## Why Three Parallel Calculations?
 * - **Earned**: Tracks billable revenue (what client pays)
 * - **Cost**: Tracks internal expense (what company pays employee)
 * - **Profit**: Tracks margin (earned - cost)
 * The user selects which to display via `config.amountDisplay`.
 *
 * ## Rate Conversion
 * Input rates are in cents (e.g., 5000 = $50/hr) to avoid float precision issues.
 * We convert to dollars by dividing by 100 before multiplication.
 *
 * ## Rounding
 * All amounts are rounded to 2 decimal places (currency precision).

// ============================================================================

/**
 * Main calculation function for overtime analysis.
 *
 * This is the heart of OTPLUS - the pure calculation engine that transforms
 * raw Clockify time entries into a complete overtime and billable analysis.
 * The function is completely deterministic and side-effect free.
 *
 * ## High-Level Algorithm
 *
 * 1. **Initialize**: Group entries by user, derive effective date range
 * 2. **For each user**:
 *    a. Group their entries by date
 *    b. For each date in range:
 *       - Determine effective capacity (accounting for holidays/time-off/overrides)
 *       - Sort entries chronologically
 *       - Apply tail attribution algorithm to split regular/OT
 *       - Calculate amounts with tier1/tier2 premiums
 *       - Aggregate to day totals
 *    c. Round and finalize user totals
 * 3. **For users without entries**: Still calculate expectedCapacity
 * 4. **Return**: Sorted array of user analyses
 *
 * ## Key Business Logic (see docs/prd.md for full details)
 *
 * **Entry Classification**:
 * - BREAK entries: Always regular, don't accumulate toward capacity
 * - PTO entries (HOLIDAY/TIME_OFF): Always regular, don't accumulate
 * - WORK entries: Subject to tail attribution, can be regular or OT
 *
 * **Capacity Resolution** (per user, per day):
 * 1. Get base capacity: per-day override > weekly > global > profile > default
 * 2. Apply adjustments:
 *    - Holiday → capacity = 0
 *    - Non-working day → capacity = 0
 *    - Time-off → capacity reduced by time-off hours
 *
 * **Tail Attribution Algorithm**:
 * - Sort entries by start time
 * - Accumulate WORK entry durations against capacity
 * - Once capacity exceeded, subsequent WORK hours become OT
 * - BREAK and PTO never accumulate (don't trigger OT for others)
 *
 * **Tier2 Overtime**:
 * - Track cumulative OT hours per user (across entire date range)
 * - Once user's total OT exceeds tier2Threshold, apply higher multiplier
 * - Tier2 accumulator is per-USER, not per-day
 *
 * **Dual-Source Detection** (Fallback Mechanism):
 * If holiday/time-off APIs fail or are disabled, the function still detects
 * holidays and time-off from entry types (type === 'HOLIDAY', 'TIME_OFF').
 * This ensures correct overtime calculation even with partial data.
 *
 * ## Input Parameters
 *
 * @param entries - Array of TimeEntry objects from Clockify Reports API.
 *   - Can be null or empty (function still calculates capacity for all users)
 *   - Each entry must have: userId, timeInterval, type, billable, rates/amounts
 *
 * @param store - Application store (or CalcStore interface) containing:
 *   - users: List of workspace users
 *   - profiles: User profiles with workCapacityHours and workingDays
 *   - holidays: Nested map of holidays (userId → dateKey → Holiday)
 *   - timeOff: Nested map of time-off (userId → dateKey → TimeOffInfo)
 *   - overrides: User-specific capacity/multiplier overrides
 *   - config: Feature flags (applyHolidays, useProfileCapacity, etc.)
 *   - calcParams: Global defaults (dailyThreshold, overtimeMultiplier, etc.)
 *
 * @param dateRange - Date range for the report (YYYY-MM-DD format).
 *   - Can be null (function derives range from entry dates)
 *   - Used to calculate expectedCapacity for all users (even without entries)
 *
 * ## Return Value
 *
 * @returns Array of UserAnalysis objects, one per user, sorted by userName.
 *   Each UserAnalysis contains:
 *   - userId, userName: User identification
 *   - days: Map<dateKey, DayData> with per-day breakdown
 *   - totals: UserTotals with aggregated hours, amounts, and context
 *
 * ## Edge Cases Handled
 *
 * - **Null entries**: Treated as empty array, still calculates capacity
 * - **Null dateRange**: Derived from entry min/max dates
 * - **No entries and no dateRange**: Returns empty array
 * - **Users not in store.users**: Added dynamically from entries
 * - **Users without entries**: Appear in results with capacity totals
 * - **Missing profiles**: Fall back to global defaults
 * - **Malformed entries**: Skipped with 0 duration (parseIsoDuration returns 0)
 * - **Missing rates**: Default to 0 (no crash)
 * - **Timezone consistency**: All dates use IsoUtils for consistent extraction
 *
 * ## Performance Considerations
 *
 * - Time Complexity: O(U * D * E_avg * log(E_avg))
 *   where U = users, D = days, E_avg = entries per day
 *   The log factor comes from sorting entries per day.
 *
 * - Space Complexity: O(U * D)
 *   Stores Map<dateKey, DayData> for each user.
 *
 * - For typical usage (100 users, 30 days, 10 entries/day):
 *   ~100 * 30 * 10 * log(10) = ~100k operations (sub-second)
 *
 * ## Determinism Guarantee
 *
 * This function is PURE and DETERMINISTIC:
 * - Same inputs ALWAYS produce same outputs
 * - No side effects (no DOM, no network, no global state)
 * - No hidden dependencies (no Date.now(), no Math.random())
 * - Calculation invariants are enforced by unit tests
 *
 * If results change unexpectedly, either:
 * 1. Input data changed (check entries, store, dateRange)
 * 2. Bug introduced (tests should catch this)
 * 3. Intentional business logic change (update tests)
 *
 * ## Related Tests

 * See `__tests__/unit/calc.test.js` for comprehensive test coverage:
 * - Entry classification (BREAK, PTO, WORK)
 * - Capacity precedence and adjustments
 * - Tail attribution algorithm
 * - Billable breakdown
 * - Tier2 overtime
 * - Edge cases (null inputs, missing data, etc.)
 *
 * @example
 * const analysis = calculateAnalysis(
 *   timeEntries, // from Clockify Reports API
 *   store,       // application state
 *   {start: "2024-01-01", end: "2024-01-31"} // January 2024
 * );
 * // → [
 * //   {userId: "user1", userName: "Alice", days: Map(...), totals: {...}},
