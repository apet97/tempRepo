# OTPLUS — Overtime Summary Addon for Clockify

## Description
This is a production-ready Clockify overtime addon. Clockify's built-in Attendance report only shows daily entries and cannot show summaries; OTPLUS fills this gap by providing summarized overtime views, profile-based capacity tracking, and billable hour breakdowns.

## Features
- **Profile-based Capacity**: Uses `workCapacity` from Clockify Member Profiles.
- **Working Days & Holidays**: Respects individual working schedules and assigned holidays.
- **Time Off Tracking**: Excludes approved time off from worked hours and reduces capacity accordingly.
- **Billable Breakdown**: Analyzes regular vs. overtime hours for billable and non-billable time.
- **Grouped Views**: Summary by User, Client, Project, Task, Date, or Week.
- **Detailed Anomalies**: Badges for holiday work and non-working day entries.
- **CSV Export**: Comprehensive exports for both summary and detailed views.
